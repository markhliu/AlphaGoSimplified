    "In this chapter, you’ll learn how minimax algorithms work. You'll use it to play the Last Coin Standing game (a.k.a. the coin game) that we developed in Chapter 1. The algorithm exhausts all possibilities in the coin game. The minimax agent plays perfectly: it always wins when it pays second. \n",
    "\n",
    "The minimax algorithm is a decision rule in artificial intelligence and game theory. The algorithm assumes that each player in the game makes the best possible decisions at each step. Further, each player knows that other players make fully rational decisions as well. In simple games such as the coin game or Tic Tac Toe, the algorithm exhausts all possible game paths and solves the game. This means the minimax algorithm provides the strongest possible for these games and no other algorithms can beat it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In more complicated games such as Connect Four or Chess, the minimax algorithm cannot exhaust all possibilities in a short amount of time. However, modifications on the minimax algorithms such as depth pruning and alpha-beta pruning (which we'll study in the next couple of chapters) make strong game players. In fact, the algorithms used by Deep Blue to beat World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov in 1997 is based on minimax with alpha-beta pruning and powerful position evaluation functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this chapter, you'll understand the basic logi behind the minimax algorithm and can design game strategies for any game based on the algorithm. "

    "## 1.2. The Minimax Algorithm with Backward Induction\n",
    "The solution in a minimax algorithm is achieved through backward induction. It starts with the terminal state of the game. In the coin game, this is when the last coin is taken by a player; in Tic Tac Toe, the terminal state is when the game is tied or when one player has connected three pieces in a row. We find out the payoff to each player in the terminal state. In the second to last stage of the game, the player looks one step ahead and makes the best decision for himself/herself, anticipating that the opponent makes the best decision in the next step, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the coin game as the example. If both players make the best decisions, the game has seven rounds and 14 steps (in each round, player 1 makes a move and player 2 makes a move). In stage 7, three coins are left in the pile and player 1 has to decide how many coins to take: 1 or 2? At this point, player 1 knows that she will lose for sure: player 2 will take the remaining one or two coins in the pile and win the game. In stage 7, six coins are left in the pile and player 1 has to decide how many coins to take: 1 or 2? Player 1 knows that if she takes 1, player will take 2; if she takes 2, player 2 will take 1. Player 2 will leave three coins in the pile no matter what... In stage 1, 21 coins are in the pile and player 1 has to decide how many coins to take: 1 or 2? Player 1 knows that if she takes 1, player will take 2; if she takes 2, player 2 will take 1. Player 2 will leave 18 coins in the pile no matter what... \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the total number of possible scenarios in a Tic Tac Toe game is small, the minimax algorithm can exhaust all scenarios in a short amount of time and find the best solution for each player in every stage of the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, for more complicated games such as Chess and Go, the total number of possible scenarios in a game is astronomical. It's impossible for the minimax algorithm to pick the best move in a reasonable amount of time. We'll discuss how to mitigate this concern in later chapters."
